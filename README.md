This project is social media website

## Description

This website is based on Facebookâ€™s website design, mainly to showcase my ability in accessing and processing data with Rest API. Since the focus is on the API only some of the elements, related to API are functional and the rest is just dummies.
The data is thanks to [DUMMYAPI.IO](https://dummyapi.io/) whose providing free ready to use API Service filled with dummy data. 
I'm using Next.JS and Typescript as the core of this web design with the help of Redux/toolkit, Redux/persist and Next Redux Wrapper. For styling I use FontAwesome Icons and Tailwind CSS
